DAY 2
I have created a student management system which can add,display,update and delete student records.
This is facilitated by the use of ArrayLists.
The student class has 3 variables-id,name and marks.
The class also has 4 methods to add a new record,view a particular record,update a particular record and delete a particular record.
This program uses a menu driven strategy to choose the options.
